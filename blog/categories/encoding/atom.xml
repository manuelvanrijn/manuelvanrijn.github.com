<h2>How it started</h2>

<p>Yesterday a customer reported that there were some weird questionmark signs when generating a PDF. Obviously this is probably caused by some html encoding or something. So me and my <a href="http://blog.dltr.nl">college</a> desided to fix this minor bug after we solved some major rocket science bug. We thought "let's do something easy to cool down a bit"</p>

<h2>Encoding</h2>

<p> changed the meta Content-Type charset to utf-8, ISO-8859-1</p>

<h2>When does it stop!</h2>

<p>Ok so at some point all our options/ideas leaded to nothing!</p>

<p>Ofcourse we read <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html">The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets (No Excuses!)</a> by Joel Spolsky, but at the header "IT'S NOG THAT HARD" we did wonder why that article was that LONG!</p>

<h2>The solution</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://stw.castleproject.org/MonoRail.Brail.ashx#HTML_Encoding_15">solution</a> .... a <code>!</code> instead of a <code>$</code> would do the trick....</p>
