<p>Because the Nano instance has some connection limitation you have to make some config changes so you won't get <code>ERR max number of clients reached</code> error messages.</p>

<h2>Why this post</h2>

<p>Today I've been struggling a lot with getting the Sidekiq to work probably with Redis to Go Nano on Heroku. The main problem was I was having difficulties with the amount of connection's being created to the Redis server. Because the Nano variant is free but large enough for handling normal sized queues of work, we have to face the limitation of 10 connections.</p>

<h2>A calculation Tool!</h2>

<p>If you just want to know what you need to change/setup you can go directly to a small tool I've built to calculate the number of connections/concurrencies need for a number of workers/web workers etc.</p>

<p><a href="http://manuel.manuelles.nl/sidekiq-heroku-redis-calc" class="special_button">SidekiqHerokuRedis calculator</a></p>

<h2>Why ERR max number of clients reached?</h2>

<p>The error <code>Error fetching message: ERR max number of clients reached</code>, is quite clear isn't it? The actual question is how we can reduce the connections being opened to match the 10 connection limit given by the Nano instance.</p>

<p>After some research I found the factors that you have to tweak in order to reach the magic number of 10.</p>

<ol>
<li>Sidekiq Client connection size</li>
<li>Sidekiq Server connection size</li>
<li>Sidekiq Server reserved connections (reserved for the Fetcher and Retrier)</li>
<li>Sidekiq concurrency size</li>
<li>Unicorn worker_process size</li>
<li>Heroku Web Dyno count</li>
<li>Heroku Worker count</li>
</ol>


<p>The answer for all our problems could be described in the following sum:</p>

<p>max connections = (Heroku worker count * (concurrency + 2 reserved connections)) + (web dyno count * (client connection size * unicorn worker_process size))</p>

<h2>Connections and concurrencies</h2>

<p>If you have a small amount of Redis connections we need to make some modifications in order to get all our processes happy and not throwing connection errors around.</p>

<p>At the bottom of this post I'll put my final configuration files.</p>

<h3>Dynos * (unicorns * client size)</h3>

<p>The first thing I changed was the Redis connection size for the client. By default Sidekiq takes <strong>5</strong> connections per client. Because my applications only queries Redis for adding tasks to the Sidekiq queue, one connection should be more than enough.</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='3 workers * dyno count = redis_connections'>
One mistake I made was forgetting about the number of dynos and Unicorn worker_process size. In my <code>app/config/unicorn.rb</code> I had <code>worker_processes 3</code> defined which actually means 3 workers * dyno count = redis_connections taken by the Client.
</span></p>

<h4>Examples:</h4>

<p>In my case where I've set the connection size to one we could have the following examples</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>1</strong> web dyno with <strong>2</strong> unicorn worker_processes takes <strong>2 Redis connections</strong></li>
<li><strong>2</strong> web dyno with <strong>2</strong> unicorn worker_processes takes <strong>4 Redis connections</strong></li>
<li><strong>5</strong> web dyno with <strong>4</strong> unicorn worker_processes takes <strong>20 Redis connections</strong></li>
</ol>


<p>If you up the client size to, for example 3 you should also multiply the Redis connections by this number (so for example 3 you'll have 20 * 3 = 60 connections).</p>

<h3>Worker * (concurrency + 2)</h3>

<p>When calculating the number of connections the Sidekiq server needs, we need to modify the number of currencies it initializes on launch. This number represents the number of threads created by the Sidekiq server which will perform queued tasks. Each concurrency/thread takes up 1 Redis connection.</p>

<p>When tweaking this number I found out the Sidekiq server took 2 additional connections upon the concurrency number. This seemed to be default behavior becase Sidekiq server uses these two for the Fetcher and Retrier commands.</p>

<h4>Examples:</h4>

<ol>
<li><strong>1</strong> worker dyno running Sidekiq, with <strong>1</strong> concurrency takes <strong>3 Redis connections</strong></li>
<li><strong>1</strong> worker dyno running Sidekiq, with <strong>2</strong> concurrency takes <strong>4 Redis connections</strong></li>
<li><strong>2</strong> worker dyno running Sidekiq, with <strong>2</strong> concurrency takes <strong>8 Redis connections</strong></li>
</ol>


<p>The default concurrency size of Sidekiq is set to 25 which mean that without modifications you need at least 27 Redis connections for the Sidekiq server.</p>

<h2>My final code</h2>

<p><code>bash
connection limit:           10
unicorn processes:           3
web dynos:                   2
worker dynos (sidekiq):      1
client pool size:            1
server pool size:            2
concurrency:                 2
</code></p>

<p>``` ruby app/config/initializers/sidekiq.rb
require 'sidekiq'</p>

<p>Sidekiq.configure_client do |config|
  config.redis = { :size => 1 }
end</p>

<p>Sidekiq.configure_server do |config|
  config.redis = { :size => 2 }
end
```</p>

<p><code>yaml app/config/sidekiq.yml
:concurrency: 2
</code></p>

<p><code>bash Procfile
web: bundle exec unicorn -p $PORT -c ./config/unicorn.rb
worker: bundle exec sidekiq -e production -C config/sidekiq.yml
</code></p>

    <updated>2012-11-13T09:02:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://manuel.manuelles.nl/blog/2012/11/13/scalable-heroku-worker-for-sidekiq</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/blog/2012/11/13/scalable-heroku-worker-for-sidekiq/"><img class="left" src="/images/posts/more-workers.jpg" width="200" height="200" title="More workers" ></a> In this post I'd like to show you guys how to deploy your Rails application to <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> with a <a href="http://sidekiq.org/">Sidekiq</a> worker that only gets initiated when there are tasks in the queue to process.</p>

<p>Our goal is to start a worker when a task is added to the queue and to destroy the worker after its done processing the queue tasks. This will result in a much lower bill at the end of the month because the worker doesn't have to be up the whole month.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Setting up Sidekiq</h2>

<p>First let's take a look at a default configuration of Sidekiq within a Rails project.</p>

<h3>Add the gem</h3>

<p>First we need to add Sidekiq to our Gemfile and run <code>bundle install</code></p>

<p><code>ruby Gemfile
gem 'sidekiq'
</code></p>

<h3>Create a Sidekiq worker</h3>

<p>The worker is very basic. It just performs some heavy task and sends an email after it finished.</p>

<p>``` ruby app/workers/my_worker.rb
class MyWorker
  include Sidekiq::Worker</p>

<p>  def perform(id)</p>

<pre><code>object = Model.find(id)
object.generate_download
UserMailer.download_is_ready(object).deliver
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<h3>Procfile</h3>

<p>In our Procfile we have to define the <code>worker</code> line to start the Sidekiq server on a Heroku worker dyno.</p>

<p><code>bash Procfile
web: bundle exec unicorn -p $PORT -c ./config/unicorn.rb
worker: bundle exec sidekiq -e production
</code></p>

<h3>Move heavy task to the queue</h3>

<p>On the controller we probably have a line calling <code>object.generate_download</code> which takes to much time. We'll change this line to execute the <code>MyWorker</code> instead:</p>

<p>``` ruby app/controllers/download_controller.rb
class DownloadController &lt; ApplicationController
  def generate</p>

<pre><code>object = Model.find(param[:id])
# instead of calling object.generate_download we'll do:
MyWorker.perform_async(object.id)
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> It's recommended not to add the whole object into the worker because this is stored in the Redis database. Also the object might be changed before it's being processed by Sidekiq. Adding the <code>id</code> and fetching the object in the worker is a better approach.</p>

<h2>So far...</h2>

<p>At this point we have configured our Rails project to add tasks to Redis and have Sidekiq perform executing the worker when a task is added. If we deploy our Rails app to Heroku we need to add the Redis To Go addon and add a Heroku worker dyno to our application.</p>

<h3>Running locally</h3>

<p>To test this locally we need:</p>

<ul>
<li>Redis installed locally and running</li>
<li>Run the Rails app (<code>bundle exec rails server</code>)</li>
<li>Run the Sidekiq server (<code>bundle exec sidekiq</code>)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Adding the autoscaler</h2>

<p>At this point the Heroku worker dyno has to be started, to pickup tasks from the queue. It's likely you do not need this worker to run the whole day because the queue might be empty most of the time. Here's where the <a href="http://github.com/JustinLove/autoscaler/">autoscaler gem</a> come's in handy.</p>

<p>This gem acts as Middleware for Sidekiq and performs the following tasks:</p>

<ol>
<li>When a task is added it checks if a Worker is present.</li>
<li>When a worker is already running it does nothing and the worker will pickup the task.</li>
<li>If there isn't a worker running it will create a Heroku worker dyno.</li>
<li>If the worker finished processing the queue it will keep the worker alive for 60 seconds just in case we add a task to the queue within this time. If no tasks are added it will destroy the worker.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Add the gem</h3>

<p>First we need to add the autoscaler gem to our Gemfile and run <code>bundle install</code></p>

<p><code>ruby Gemfile
gem 'autoscaler'
</code></p>

<h3>Adding required ENV variables</h3>

<p>The gem requires two environment variables to be set on your Heroku application. The <code>HEROKU_API_KEY</code> is required to perform creating and removing a Heroku worker dyno and the <code>HEROKU_APP</code> to know on which application it has to create/destroy the worker dyno on.</p>

<p>``` bash</p>

<h1>API KEY can be found on https://dashboard.heroku.com/account</h1>

<p>heroku config:add HEROKU_API_KEY=123-your-key-456
heroku config:add HEROKU_APP=your_heroku_app_name
```</p>

<h3>Tweaking the Sidekiq initializer</h3>

<p>Because this gem acts as Middleware we need to create a <code>sidekiq.rb</code> in our initializers folder. This file will check if we are running on Heroku and if so, activates the autoscaler as Middleware.</p>

<p>``` ruby app/config/initializers/sidekiq.rb
require 'sidekiq'
require 'autoscaler/sidekiq'
require 'autoscaler/heroku_scaler'</p>

<p>heroku = nil
if ENV['HEROKU_APP']
  heroku = Autoscaler::HerokuScaler.new
end</p>

<p>Sidekiq.configure_client do |config|
  if heroku</p>

<pre><code>config.client_middleware do |chain|
  chain.add Autoscaler::Sidekiq::Client, 'default' =&gt; heroku
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end</p>

<p>Sidekiq.configure_server do |config|
  config.server_middleware do |chain|</p>

<pre><code>if heroku
  p "[Sidekiq] Running on Heroku, autoscaler is used"
  chain.add(Autoscaler::Sidekiq::Server, heroku, 60) # 60 seconds timeout
else
  p "[Sidekiq] Running locally, so autoscaler isn't used"
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<h2>Ready to go!</h2>

<p>At this point we're ready to deploy our application to Heroku and let the autscaler automatically create and destroy a worker dyno whenever it needs to process tasks from the Sidekiq queue.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/blog/2012/06/20/taking-memsql-for-a-spin/"><img class="left" src="/images/posts/memsql.png" width="200" height="200" title="MemSQL" ></a> This week I read an article on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4126007">HackerNews</a> about Ex-facebook employs releasing a new database server called MemSQL.</p>

<p>After viewing there <a href="http://developers.memsql.com/">product overview video</a> I got excited and wanted to take this product for a spin.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>What to test?</h2>

<p>First I needed a project for testing the performance on. At <a href="http://www.auxilium.nl">my work</a> we developed a Rails application that needs to validate a permit request with rules, questions, filters, answers depending on a region etc. etc. This process of validating a whole permit request takes some time because it has to perform <strong>6850 queries</strong>.</p>

<h2>Performance PostgreSQL</h2>

<p>At this moment the application runs on a PostgreSQL database so lets see what the performance is at this point:</p>

<p>```
run       user     system      total        real</p>

<h1>01  10.690000   0.540000  11.230000 ( 14.828312)</h1>

<h1>02   9.450000   0.490000   9.940000 ( 13.895988)</h1>

<h1>03   9.550000   0.470000  10.020000 ( 14.215028)</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='14.312ms for 6850 queries'>
The average result is that it takes 14.312ms for 6850 queries on PostgreSQL.
</span></p>

<h2>Configuring the Rails app to use MemSQL</h2>

<p>After installing MemSQL and starting it running on port 3307, I created a new database added the existing data and changed some connection strings for the Rails app.</p>

<h3>mysql2 gem</h3>

<p>Because MemSQL is built on top of MySQL you can use all the MySQL client tools to perform operations on MemSQL.</p>

<p>The MemSQL documentation recommended using the memsql2 gem but to do this I had to install MySQL first on my machine.</p>

<h3>Failed to connect?</h3>

<p>After installing MySQL and configured the Rails application I got some strange error when starting the application.</p>

<p><code>
Failed to connect to database:
  Sequel::AdapterNotFound -&gt; LoadError: dlopen(.rbenv/versions/1.9.3-p194/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/mysql2-0.3.11/lib/mysql2/mysql2.bundle, 9): Library not loaded: /usr/local/mysql/lib/libmysqlclient.16.dylib
  Referenced from: /Users/mvanrijn/.rbenv/versions/1.9.3-p194/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/mysql2-0.3.11/lib/mysql2/mysql2.bundle
  Reason: image not found - /Users/mvanrijn/.rbenv/versions/1.9.3-p194/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/mysql2-0.3.11/lib/mysql2/mysql2.bundle
</code></p>

<p>After some googling I found out that on OSX you might need to symlink the dylib manually. <strong>NOTE</strong> Because I've installed a newer version of MySQL I have a <code>libmysqlclient.18.dylib</code> instead of the required <code>libmysqlclient.16.dylib</code>. Symlinking this file from libmysqlclient.18.dylib to libmysqlclient.16.dylib seemed to work for me.</p>

<p><code>
sudo ln -s /usr/local/mysql/lib/libmysqlclient.18.dylib /usr/local/mysql/lib/libmysqlclient.16.dylib
</code></p>

<h3>Explain not supported for joins</h3>

<p>At this point I am able to connect to the database and perform the benchmark, but I got the next error:</p>

<p><code>
ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid: Mysql2::Error: Feature 'EXPLAIN for join queries' is not supported by MemSQL.
</code></p>

<p>Apparently I've EXPLAIN queries on in my config and this isn't supported for JOIN queries as MemSQL tells us.</p>

<p>To resolve this you just have to modify/add this line in your <code>config/environment/development.rb</code></p>

<p><code>
config.active_record.auto_explain_threshold_in_seconds = nil
</code></p>

<h2>MemSQL's first spin!</h2>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='first run took 3 min and 05 seconds!'>
So after resolving all these issues I was able to run the benchmark, but the first run took 3 min and 05 seconds! First I thought that this can not be right, but I forgot the fact that it generate's c code from the queries.
</span></p>

<p>On the MemSQL server I got the following output:</p>

<p><code>``sql
2908919519 2012-06-20 09:56:16 INFO: Query appdb.'SELECT </code>permit_requests<code>.* FROM</code>permit_requests<code> WHERE</code>permit_requests<code>.</code>id<code>= @ LIMIT @' compiled in 7306 milliseconds
2908983637 2012-06-20 09:56:16 WARNING: WARN DISABLED LOCKDOWN: BEGIN TRANSACTION
2916240227 2012-06-20 09:56:23 INFO: Query appdb.'SELECT </code>categories<code>.* FROM</code>categories<code> WHERE</code>categories<code>.</code>id<code>= @ ORDER BY name LIMIT @' compiled in 7203 milliseconds
2924143142 2012-06-20 09:56:31 INFO: Query appdb.'SELECT</code>questions<code>.* FROM</code>questions<code> WHERE</code>questions<code>.</code>category_id` = @ ORDER BY position' compiled in 7722 milliseconds</p>

<p>... etc ...
```</p>

<p>As you can see, generating the compiled version for every query took about 7 seconds.</p>

<h2>Performance MemSQL</h2>

<p>So below again the same table with results. The first line is the time with generating all the compiled queries:</p>

<p>```
run       user     system      total        real</p>

<h1>01   5.260000   0.360000   5.620000 (183.511099)</h1>

<h1>02   3.830000   0.260000   4.090000 (  6.657682)</h1>

<h1>03   3.790000   0.260000   4.050000 (  6.613542)</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='6.635ms for 6850 queries'>
The performance boost is quite huge! The average result is 6.635ms for 6850 queries if we are skipping the first result. This means it's like 7.677ms faster!
</span></p>

<h3>Cold boot of MemSQL</h3>

<p>I've also tried the performance when I restart the database server. I just wanted to know if it keeps the data in memory and would take longer to run after a restart.</p>

<p>The result:</p>

<p>```
run       user     system      total        real</p>

<h1>01   5.110000   0.330000   5.440000 (  8.030930)</h1>

<h1>02   3.770000   0.260000   4.030000 (  6.580312)</h1>

<h1>03   3.780000   0.250000   4.030000 (  6.524884)</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='7.044ms for 6850 queries'>
The first time it took just a bit longer, but with an average of 7.044ms for 6850 queries this is still faster than running it on PostgreSQL!
</span></p>

<h2>Pros and Cons</h2>

<p>Here's a list with some pros and cons I noticed while experimenting with MemSQL:</p>

<h3>Pros</h3>

<ul>
<li>Blazing fast!</li>
<li>You can use all the MySQL client tools out there. Also because it uses MySQL, troubleshooting might not be an issue because it isn't a new product.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Cons</h3>

<ul>
<li>Huge cache folder! After restoring the database (15Mb) MemSQL creates a folder in the <code>plancache</code> folder which is <strong>5.5GB</strong>. So performance comes with a price I think.</li>
<li>Unable to create users. When creating the database, I tried to add a new user but this isn't supported. Maybe this is because I'm using the Developer Edition.</li>
</ul>

Today I had to reinstall my Linux installation because my harddisk died a quick dead. While configuring all the software I use to develop I got some weird error after I'd installed <a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv">rbenv</a> and tried to execute <code>bundle install</code> on one of our projects.<br /><br /></p>

<h2>The error</h2>

<p>The following error was raised when I tried to install capybara-webkit</p>

<p>```

<h2>The solution</h2>

<p>I first thought there were some problems with <code>make</code> or <code>cmake</code> because that's what the error says. <code>qmake: not found</code>, but that didn't seem to be te real problem.</p>

<p>After some googlefoo I found out that I was missing the <code>libqtwebkit-dev</code> package. So the problem in this case was easily resolved by running:</p>

<p><code>
sudo apt-get install libqtwebkit-dev

<p>After a long search I wasn't able to find a stable, well tested gem, I could use in our Rails project, so I developed the <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/ideal-mollie">ideal-mollie gem</a>. After I finishing this gem, there was only one problem.</p>

<p>When you want to test a iDeal transaction with the Mollie test bank, you <strong>MUST</strong> do some routing, so that Mollie can send you a request if the payment was paid or not, to your local machine from the internet. So I made a alternative Mollie test bank you can use for what ever programming language you use for making Mollie iDeal payments without the routing problems.</p>

<p>I've came op with a gem that runs a small <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a> application that does exactly the same as the Mollie test bank, only it runs on your local machine, which means you can redirect to <code>localhost</code> and more important, it can perform the payment check.</p>

<p>Here you can find the <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/mollie-bank">mollie-bank gem</a>, and the <a href="https://github.com/manuelvanrijn/mollie-bank">source code</a></p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/mollie-bank.png"></p>

<h2>Install en run!</h2>

<p>To use mollie-bank just install the gem by running</p>

<p><code>
gem install mollie-bank
</code></p>

<p>and then run it</p>

<p><code>
mollie-bank
</code></p>

<p>At this point, you can go to <a href="http://localhost:4567/">http://localhost:4567/</a> and you'll see an intro page.</p>

<h2>Setup your application</h2>

<p>Alright so now you only have to make sure that when you're developing on your local machine, you don't make the requests to Mollie but to your locally running Mollie Bank.</p>

<p>To do this you just have to change <code>https://secure.mollie.nl</code> into <code>http://localhost:4567</code> in you code.</p>

<h2>Todo</h2>

<p>At this point I've only wrote a sample implementation for <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/" title="Ruby on Rails">Ruby on Rails</a> on the <a href="https://github.com/manuelvanrijn/mollie-bank/wiki/Implement-into-existing-modules">Implement into existing modules Wiki</a> page, but soon there will be more examples.</p>
