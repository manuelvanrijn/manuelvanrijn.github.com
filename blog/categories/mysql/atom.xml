    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/blog/2013/03/04/rails-belongs-to-to-has-many/"><img class="right" src="/images/posts/developing-ruby-on-rails-on-windows.png" width="250" height="250" title="Develop Ruby on Rails on Windows" ></a> I do a lot of C# web development which means I have to work with Visual Studio on Windows. I usually grab the Mac to do my Ruby on Rails development, but it would be easier not to switch every time I have to do C# and Ruby development.</p>

<p>A while ago I tried several things getting a fast Rails experience on Windows, but it failed. It was just too slow ... until now! In this post I'd like to share my current setup which I plan to use as long as it pleases me.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>What are we going to do?</h2>

<p>We are going to install <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> which uses <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> to build a complete development environment. Also we will create and use some <a href="http://community.opscode.com/">recipes for Chef</a> to automatically install and configure the development environment. Think of installing Ruby, PostgreSQL, and MySQL etc. automatically.</p>

<h2>Installing Vagrant and VirtualBox</h2>

<p>First let's setup our Windows machine with the needed software.</p>

<ol>
<li>Install <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">VirtualBox</a></li>
<li>Install <a href="http://downloads.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a></li>
<li>After reboot add the VirtualBox folder to your PATH variable<br />(something like: <code>c:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox</code>)</li>
<li>Install <a href="http://www.vagrantbox.es/">a base box</a> (I used Ubuntu precise 64 VirtualBox) with the following command
<code>vagrant box add precise64 http://files.vagrantup.com/precise64.box</code></li>
</ol>


<h2>Prepare your Rails project</h2>

<p>Next we have to configure our project to create a box from the base box and make it install all our goodies we need to run our Rails application.</p>

<h3>Setup Chef (Librarian)</h3>

<p>I'm using a gem called <a href="https://github.com/applicationsonline/librarian-chef">librarian-chef</a> which actually is a bundler for your Chef recipes.</p>

<p>To install run the following from the root of you project:</p>

<p>``` bash</p>

<h1>Install librarian-chef</h1>

<p>gem install librarian-chef</p>

<h1>Add its work directories to your gitignore</h1>

<p>echo chef/cookbooks >> .gitignore
echo chef/tmp >> .gitignore</p>

<h1>OPTIONAL: you can add the Cheffile.lock which holds the currently installed versions</h1>

<h1>just like bundler does</h1>

<p>echo chef/Cheffile.lock >> .gitignore</p>

<h1>Create the Librarian config file and needed folders</h1>

<p>mkdir -p chef
cd chef
mkdir -p roles
mkdir -p site-cookbooks
librarian-chef init
```</p>

<h4>WUT?! gem install librarian-chef?</h4>

<p>I know we are trying to create a non-Ruby Windows solution but we do need this gem to work on Windows to complete our setup with Chef. If you really don't want Ruby being installed on Windows, you should do the above steps on UNIX or OSX and also have to commit the cookbooks. This means we're back at 1900 where everybody stuffed there vendor folder with code they found... If you do want to perform this on Windows and haven't already installed Ruby, you should do this now (I suggest <a href="http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/">RubyInstaller</a>).</p>

<h3>Configure Chef</h3>

<p>The command <code>librarian-chef init</code> created the file <code>chef/Cheffile</code> where we can add our cookbooks. Mine contains the following:</p>

<p>``` ruby <strong>chef/Cheffile</strong></p>

<h1>!/usr/bin/env ruby</h1>

<h1>^syntax detection</h1>

<p>site 'http://community.opscode.com/api/v1'</p>

<p>cookbook 'apt'
cookbook 'git'
cookbook 'sqlite'
cookbook 'mysql'
cookbook 'postgresql'
cookbook 'database', :git => 'git://github.com/manuelvanrijn/cookbook-database.git', :ref => 'grant-roles'
cookbook 'nodejs'
cookbook 'build-essential'
cookbook 'ruby_build'
cookbook 'rbenv', :git => 'git://github.com/fnichol/chef-rbenv.git', :ref => 'v0.7.2'
```</p>

<p>As you can see I've setup Git, Ruby with rbenv, SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL and node.js for the asset pipeline. The <code>apt</code> cookbook is for running <code>apt-get dist-upgrade</code> and the cookbook <code>database</code> will be used later to create users to access the databases.</p>

<p>You could skip one or two of the database servers if you like, but it can't harm if you do install them all and don't use them.</p>

<p>Note: the <code>database</code> cookbook is provided with additional actions to set superuser privileges to PostgreSQL and MySQL.</p>

<h4>Downloading the cookbooks</h4>

<p>Now that we have defined our cookbooks we need to run our final command so that Chef downloads them. Just as you would do with bundler we now run the following command from our <code>chef/</code> folder</p>

<p><code>bash
librarian-chef install
</code></p>

<h3>Adding our custom recipes</h3>

<p>I had some difficulties with running <code>bundle install</code> because the Vagrant user didn't have permissions on the rbenv gem folder, so I had to add a custom recipe for this. Also I've added a recipe to modify the <code>pg_hba.conf</code> file of PostgreSQL so that we can connect with the virtual machine. Finally I've created a file to add our database users with full permissions. Here are the 3 files I added:</p>

<p>``` ruby <strong>chef/site-cookbooks/database/recipes/default.rb</strong></p>

<h1>Setup database servers</h1>

<p>#</p>

<h1>1. Setup MySQL and PostgreSQL</h1>

<h1>2. Create a rails user with a blank password with full control</h1>

<h1>MySQL</h1>

<p>mysql_connection_info = {
  :host     => "localhost",
  :username => 'root',
  :password => node['mysql']['server_root_password']
}</p>

<h1>'rails'@'localhost'</h1>

<p>mysql_database_user 'rails' do
  connection mysql_connection_info
  password ''
  host 'localhost'
  privileges ["ALL PRIVILEGES"]
  grant_option true
  action :grant
end</p>

<h1>'rails'@'%'</h1>

<p>mysql_database_user 'rails' do
  connection mysql_connection_info
  password ''
  host '%'
  privileges ["ALL PRIVILEGES"]
  grant_option true
  action :grant
end</p>

<h1>PostgreSQL</h1>

<p>template "#{node[:postgresql][:dir]}/pg_hba.conf" do
  source "pg_hba.conf.erb"
  notifies :restart, "service[postgresql]", :immediately
end</p>

<p>postgresql_connection_info = {
  :host     => "localhost",
  :password => node['postgresql']['password']['postgres']
}</p>

<p>postgresql_database_user 'rails' do
  connection postgresql_connection_info
  password ''
  role_attributes :superuser => true, :createdb => true
  action :create
end
```</p>

<p><code>ruby &lt;strong&gt;chef/site-cookbooks/database/templates/default/pg_hba.conf.erb&lt;/strong&gt;
local   all             all                                     trust
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            trust
host    all             all             ::1/128                 trust
</code></p>

<p>``` ruby <strong>chef/site-cookbooks/postinstall/recipes/default.rb</strong>
group "rbenv" do
  action :create
  members "vagrant"
  gid 1100
  append true
end</p>

<p>bash "chgrp and chmod" do
  user "root"
  cwd "/usr/local"
  code &lt;&lt;-EOH</p>

<pre><code>chgrp -R rbenv rbenv
chmod -R g+rwxX rbenv
</code></pre>

<p>  EOH
end
```</p>

<h3>Adding our role</h3>

<p>Next we have to create a role that defines what recipes should be executed in what order. Create the file <code>chef/roles/rails-dev.rb</code> containing the following content:</p>

<p>``` ruby <strong>chef/roles/rails-dev.rb</strong>
name "rails-dev"
description "setup for ruby on rails core development"
run_list(
  "recipe[apt]",
  "recipe[git]",
  "recipe[sqlite]",
  "recipe[mysql::client]",
  "recipe[mysql::ruby]",
  "recipe[mysql::server]",
  "recipe[postgresql::ruby]",
  "recipe[postgresql::server]",
  "recipe[nodejs::install_from_binary]",
  "recipe[ruby_build]",
  "recipe[rbenv::system]",
  "recipe[rbenv::vagrant]",
  "recipe[database]",
  "recipe[postinstall]"
)
default_attributes(
  "build_essential" => {</p>

<pre><code>"compiletime" =&gt; true
</code></pre>

<p>  }
)
```</p>

<p>If you removed some cookbooks from the <code>chef/Cheffile</code> you should also remove them here.</p>

<h3>Setup Vagrant</h3>

<p>Next we need to create a <code>Vagrantfile</code> that contains the configurations for creating a box from the base box. Create the config file by running from the root of you project:</p>

<p><code>bash
vagrant init precise64
</code></p>

<p>Note: <code>precise64</code> is the name we used with the <code>vagrant box add</code> command from step 4 above.</p>

<p>Also we want to add the virtual machine folder to our <code>.gitignore</code> file:</p>

<p><code>bash
echo .vagrant &gt;&gt; .gitignore
</code></p>

<h4>Modify the Vagrantfile</h4>

<p>Here's the stripped version of how my file looks like:</p>

<p>``` ruby Vagrantfile
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box = "precise64"</p>

<p>  config.vm.box_url = "http://files.vagrantup.com/precise64.box"</p>

<p>  config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 3000, host: 3000  # forward the default rails port
  config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 3306, host: 3306  # forward the MySQL port
  config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 5432, host: 5432  # forward the PostgreSQL port</p>

<p>  config.vm.provision :shell, :inline => "gem install chef --version 11.6.0"</p>

<p>  config.vm.provision :chef_solo do |chef|</p>

<pre><code>chef.cookbooks_path = ["chef/cookbooks", "chef/site-cookbooks"]
chef.roles_path     = [[:host, "chef/roles"]]

chef.add_role "rails-dev"
chef.json = {
  "mysql" =&gt; {
    "server_root_password"   =&gt; "",
    "server_debian_password" =&gt; "",
    "server_repl_password"   =&gt; ""
  },
  "postgresql" =&gt; {
    "password" =&gt; {
      "postgres" =&gt; ""
    }
  },
  "rbenv" =&gt; {
    "global" =&gt; "2.0.0-p247",
    "rubies" =&gt; ["2.0.0-p247"],
    "gems" =&gt; {
      "2.0.0-p247" =&gt; [
        { "name" =&gt; "bundler" }
      ]
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<h2>Ready to rock!</h2>

<p>Alright we're ready. We now can boot up Vagrant which will take some time the first time because it will create a new box from the base box and install all the cookbooks. From then you're able to connect with the box and use it just like you would do on UNIX or OSX.</p>

<p>``` bash</p>

<h1>starts and setups the box</h1>

<p>vagrant up</p>

<h1>... now we wait ...</h1>

<h1>connect to the box with ssh</h1>

<p>vagrant ssh</p>

<h1>install gems and run the server on the box for a Rails application</h1>

<p>cd /vagrant
bundle install
bundle exec rails s
```</p>

<h3>What we've created</h3>

<p>A VirtualBox with Ubuntu precise 64 installed and containing the following software/configurations:</p>

<ul>
<li>Software:

<ol>
<li>rbenv with ruby-build</li>
<li>ruby-2.0.0-p247</li>
<li>Git</li>
<li>SQLite</li>
<li>MySQL with user: <code>rails</code> with a empty password</li>
<li>PostgreSQL with user: <code>rails</code> with a empty password</li>
<li>node.js</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Ports:

<ol>
<li><code>localhost:3000</code> goes to <code>vagrant-box:3000</code></li>
<li><code>localhost:3306</code> goes to <code>vagrant-box:3306</code></li>
<li><code>localhost:5432</code> goes to <code>vagrant-box:5432</code></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Develop workflow</h2>

<p>If you have to run specific Ruby (on Rails) tasks like <code>rspec</code> or <code>bundle exec rails g migration</code> you should do this within the ssh session of your box.</p>

<p>Editing files can be done on your Windows machine, because the root of you project is directly binded to the <code>/vagrant/</code> folder on the box.</p>

<p>After viewing there <a href="http://developers.memsql.com/">product overview video</a> I got excited and wanted to take this product for a spin.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>What to test?</h2>

<p>First I needed a project for testing the performance on. At <a href="http://www.auxilium.nl">my work</a> we developed a Rails application that needs to validate a permit request with rules, questions, filters, answers depending on a region etc. etc. This process of validating a whole permit request takes some time because it has to perform <strong>6850 queries</strong>.</p>

<h2>Performance PostgreSQL</h2>

<p>At this moment the application runs on a PostgreSQL database so lets see what the performance is at this point:</p>

<p>```
run       user     system      total        real</p>

<h1>01  10.690000   0.540000  11.230000 ( 14.828312)</h1>

<h1>02   9.450000   0.490000   9.940000 ( 13.895988)</h1>

<h1>03   9.550000   0.470000  10.020000 ( 14.215028)</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='14.312ms for 6850 queries'>
The average result is that it takes 14.312ms for 6850 queries on PostgreSQL.
</span></p>

<h2>Configuring the Rails app to use MemSQL</h2>

<p>After installing MemSQL and starting it running on port 3307, I created a new database added the existing data and changed some connection strings for the Rails app.</p>

<h3>mysql2 gem</h3>

<p>Because MemSQL is built on top of MySQL you can use all the MySQL client tools to perform operations on MemSQL.</p>

<p>The MemSQL documentation recommended using the memsql2 gem but to do this I had to install MySQL first on my machine.</p>

<h3>Failed to connect?</h3>

<p>After installing MySQL and configured the Rails application I got some strange error when starting the application.</p>

<p><code>
Failed to connect to database:
  Sequel::AdapterNotFound -&gt; LoadError: dlopen(.rbenv/versions/1.9.3-p194/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/mysql2-0.3.11/lib/mysql2/mysql2.bundle, 9): Library not loaded: /usr/local/mysql/lib/libmysqlclient.16.dylib
  Referenced from: /Users/mvanrijn/.rbenv/versions/1.9.3-p194/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/mysql2-0.3.11/lib/mysql2/mysql2.bundle
  Reason: image not found - /Users/mvanrijn/.rbenv/versions/1.9.3-p194/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/mysql2-0.3.11/lib/mysql2/mysql2.bundle
</code></p>

<p>After some googling I found out that on OSX you might need to symlink the dylib manually. <strong>NOTE</strong> Because I've installed a newer version of MySQL I have a <code>libmysqlclient.18.dylib</code> instead of the required <code>libmysqlclient.16.dylib</code>. Symlinking this file from libmysqlclient.18.dylib to libmysqlclient.16.dylib seemed to work for me.</p>

<p><code>
sudo ln -s /usr/local/mysql/lib/libmysqlclient.18.dylib /usr/local/mysql/lib/libmysqlclient.16.dylib
</code></p>

<h3>Explain not supported for joins</h3>

<p>At this point I am able to connect to the database and perform the benchmark, but I got the next error:</p>

<p><code>
ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid: Mysql2::Error: Feature 'EXPLAIN for join queries' is not supported by MemSQL.
</code></p>

<p>Apparently I've EXPLAIN queries on in my config and this isn't supported for JOIN queries as MemSQL tells us.</p>

<p>To resolve this you just have to modify/add this line in your <code>config/environment/development.rb</code></p>

<p><code>
config.active_record.auto_explain_threshold_in_seconds = nil
</code></p>

<h2>MemSQL's first spin!</h2>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='first run took 3 min and 05 seconds!'>
So after resolving all these issues I was able to run the benchmark, but the first run took 3 min and 05 seconds! First I thought that this can not be right, but I forgot the fact that it generate's c code from the queries.
</span></p>

<p>On the MemSQL server I got the following output:</p>

<p><code>``sql
2908919519 2012-06-20 09:56:16 INFO: Query appdb.'SELECT </code>permit_requests<code>.* FROM</code>permit_requests<code> WHERE</code>permit_requests<code>.</code>id<code>= @ LIMIT @' compiled in 7306 milliseconds
2908983637 2012-06-20 09:56:16 WARNING: WARN DISABLED LOCKDOWN: BEGIN TRANSACTION
2916240227 2012-06-20 09:56:23 INFO: Query appdb.'SELECT </code>categories<code>.* FROM</code>categories<code> WHERE</code>categories<code>.</code>id<code>= @ ORDER BY name LIMIT @' compiled in 7203 milliseconds
2924143142 2012-06-20 09:56:31 INFO: Query appdb.'SELECT</code>questions<code>.* FROM</code>questions<code> WHERE</code>questions<code>.</code>category_id` = @ ORDER BY position' compiled in 7722 milliseconds</p>

<p>... etc ...
```</p>

<p>As you can see, generating the compiled version for every query took about 7 seconds.</p>

<h2>Performance MemSQL</h2>

<p>So below again the same table with results. The first line is the time with generating all the compiled queries:</p>

<p>```
run       user     system      total        real</p>

<h1>01   5.260000   0.360000   5.620000 (183.511099)</h1>

<h1>02   3.830000   0.260000   4.090000 (  6.657682)</h1>

<h1>03   3.790000   0.260000   4.050000 (  6.613542)</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='6.635ms for 6850 queries'>
The performance boost is quite huge! The average result is 6.635ms for 6850 queries if we are skipping the first result. This means it's like 7.677ms faster!
</span></p>

<h3>Cold boot of MemSQL</h3>

<p>I've also tried the performance when I restart the database server. I just wanted to know if it keeps the data in memory and would take longer to run after a restart.</p>

<p>The result:</p>

<p>```
run       user     system      total        real</p>

<h1>01   5.110000   0.330000   5.440000 (  8.030930)</h1>

<h1>02   3.770000   0.260000   4.030000 (  6.580312)</h1>

<h1>03   3.780000   0.250000   4.030000 (  6.524884)</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='7.044ms for 6850 queries'>
The first time it took just a bit longer, but with an average of 7.044ms for 6850 queries this is still faster than running it on PostgreSQL!
</span></p>

<h2>Pros and Cons</h2>

<p>Here's a list with some pros and cons I noticed while experimenting with MemSQL:</p>

<h3>Pros</h3>

<ul>
<li>Blazing fast!</li>
<li>You can use all the MySQL client tools out there. Also because it uses MySQL, troubleshooting might not be an issue because it isn't a new product.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Cons</h3>

<ul>
<li>Huge cache folder! After restoring the database (15Mb) MemSQL creates a folder in the <code>plancache</code> folder which is <strong>5.5GB</strong>. So performance comes with a price I think.</li>
<li>Unable to create users. When creating the database, I tried to add a new user but this isn't supported. Maybe this is because I'm using the Developer Edition.</li>
</ul>
