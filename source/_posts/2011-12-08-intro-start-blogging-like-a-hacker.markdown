I've just decided to switch from [Wordpress](http://www.wordpress.com/ "Wordpress") to [Octopress](http://octopress.org/ "Octopress") because I wanted something new and not something over-featured

All the plugins and choice's I had to made, and the maintenance of all these, just kept me from doing what I supposed to do with it, blogging.

So after some googling what a good alternative would be for Wordpress I found *Octopress* {" A blogging framework for hackers. "} Alright +1 for the title
{% endpullquote %}

So basically Octopress generates (bakes) HTML content from the [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ "Markdown") content you write. I like this simplicity and I love the syntax.

[Octopress](http://octopress.org/ "Octopress") give's you the functionality to host it on your own server, but also to host it on [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/ "Heroku") or [Github](https://github.com/ "Github"). Beside the Git approach (push your source and deploy the generated code to the master branch) you can use RSync to sync files to your server. I use [Github](https://github.com "Github") to store my source and generated html.

Enough talking about [Octopress](http://octopress.org/ "Octopress") for now. I'll hope to post my next post soon.
